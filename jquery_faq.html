    <h1>10 Frequently Asked National Parks Questions</h1>
    <p></p>
    <main>
        <dl>
            <dt class="hoverable">Is it okay to feed the animals?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">No, wild animals are very dangerous.  You should keep your distance.</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">What if they look friendly?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">They are not.  Even the cute ones</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">Why would God make bears look so huggable if I weren't supposed to hug one?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">You'll have to ask God that one.  We are straying off topic.  This is an FAQ about the whole park, not just the wildlife.</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">Can I start a fire?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">You can start a fire, as long as you put it out.  That is a perfectly acceptable outdoor activity.  Unless we are under a fire watch, which happens more and more because we're rolling back regulations on industry... ah, this isn't the place.  Next question.</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">Who owns the National Forest?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Technically, if you pay taxes... You do!</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">So all of the huggable bears and puppy wolves are mine?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">No...</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">But you said I own them.</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Not a question, but I'll answer anyway.  We share the land.  The animals, however, are wild and can be governed by no man.</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">Who is going to stop me if I domesticate, say, a bald eagle?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The eagle may try and stop you.  With it's very sharp talons.</dd>
            
            <dt class="hoverable">Why are there so many rules around what we can and can't do with the wildlife.</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Every rule in the National Forest is written in blood.  The park rangers will not always be there to enforce said rules.  Do with that info what you must.</dd>

            <dt class="hoverable">So I CAN feed the animals?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Do what you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.</dd>
