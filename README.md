# Codeup-Web-Excersises

This is simply a repository that will collect all of the web-exercises that I complete from a former bootcamp-style coding curriculum while I wait for SMU's bootcamp to start.

## Description

Don't ask me how I came into possession of the late company's bootcamp-style curriculum materials, my answer at any rate would be: "Magic".  They are incomplete anyway, so I am doing as much as I can.
